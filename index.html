| Bill Lumsden hard at work in the Glenmorangie stillhouse.
Scotch whisky&#x27;s mad scientist sets his sights on Sonoma for a different take on Glenmorangie.

Would Glenmorangie&#x27;s director of whisky creation Bill Lumsden have left his whisky in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay casks for 15 years if he hadn&#x27;t forgotten all about it?
No way, he says: it should have been tannic, austere and horrible after all that time, which was what happened the first time he experimented with Tokaj casks. He loved the result o…</span>

关于葡萄酒审美的标准，无论是专业人士还是爱好者，都未能达成共识。
WSET教育尝试指给我们一条道路：BLCT，即通过“平衡性”（balance）、“余味长短”（length）、“复杂度”（complexity）和“典型性”（typicity）四大标准来评判一款酒的质量。该评价体系容易上手和掌握，但缺点也非常明显：它可以应付葡萄酒世界中90%的酒款，但一旦上升到大酒阶段，便不足以展现出酒款之间的参差。
而大酒之所以为大酒，一定比BLCT满分酒多了某种难以言说的气质，使其超凡脱俗、无可取代。这种气质即为风格（style）。正所谓，好可以千篇一律，美必须独树一帜。这就好比在时尚界，越是顶级的大牌，其风格越鲜明，且一经确立就不再改变，无论经过多少次季节轮转，始终万变不离其宗。

A guarantee to his customers that they were getting what they paid for, it followed the practices of the great estates of Bordeaux and was a powerful statement of intent.
It was clearly justified: in 1895 Marqués de Riscal became the first non-French winery to win a Diplome d’Honneur at the …</span>

△ 日本秋田市内的“新政”看板


“新政酒造”于1852年（江户时代末期）在日本东北地区秋田县创立。而佐藤祐辅是其第八任社长。他出生于1974年，适逢日本经济高度成长期，清酒的销售有极好的势头。在这个鼎盛期过了以后，清酒的消费每况愈下。近两年，出货量还不及20世纪70年代的一半。相反，海外的输出量倒是在不断增加。



佐藤祐辅在东京大学文学部毕业以后，在记者这个行业闯荡了几年。2007年，他选择回到老家造酒。作为一位经历特殊，并且在这变革期肩负着使命的新一代经营者，我们听听他怎么说。

「制造以信念为名的清酒。」

△ 佐藤祐辅


Q：孩提时代，你是如何看待制酒这种家业的？
佐藤：我住的地方和造酒的酒藏之间隔着条河，所以家离酒藏一点也不近。至于造酒现场嘛，其实是很危险的。所以，我并不是看着造酒的制作过程长大的。如…</span>

                    <span>英国用了1316天脱离欧盟，苏格兰却意欲脱离英国，如今正在吹响第二次独立公投的冲锋号。同样，在葡萄酒产区的世界里同样在上演这样的“独立”戏码。
根据《卫报》最新报道，近日，西班牙巴斯克地区超过50名酿酒师正在寻求欧盟批准他们脱离里奥哈DOCa认证，即不在他们的酒标上面贴上里奥哈（Rioja DOCa）的标签。

众所周知，里奥哈优质原产地分为三个子产区：上里奥哈（La Rioja）、里奥哈阿拉维萨
（Rioja Alavesa）和东里奥Rioja Oriental(原下里奥哈Rioja Baja)，这些子产区在地理上跨越三个自治区，包括拉里奥哈、纳瓦拉和位于巴斯克地区的阿拉瓦（Álava）。
根据报道，巴斯克大区里奥哈阿拉维萨子产区辖下的50多名酿酒师希望退出里奥哈优质原产地，并创建他们自己的原产地命名，新产区名字为：Arabako Mahastiak或Viñedos de Álava。（只有我觉着这个新名字很笨重吗？）

新提议已经获得了巴斯克执政党民族主义党派和马德里政府的批准，并已提交给欧盟等待批准。

A discussion ensues, and at one point a more experienced drinker – maybe a wine trade person – steps in and says why don’t you try wine Y instead of this – it costs about the same, or maybe just a little more, and it’s a much better wine. You might like it more.

Striding through the rows of grapevines in Sonoma’s Moon Mountain Vineyard, Erich Bradley waves an arm at the burnt-brown grass and chaparral surrounding his vineyard.
“The flora and fauna that surround the vineyard are so dry, it looks like the second week of July instead of the second week of May,” the winemaker says.

                    <span>With pink Prosecco proving an unprecedented success, producers are predicting a rosé Prosecco shortage this year, due to a lack of availability of eligible Pinot Noir grapes.

Paolo Lasagni, managing director at Casa Vinicolo Bosco, told db that pink Prosecco relied on young vineyards planted across the nine production zones of Prosecco, many of which were not offering substantial yields.
Pinot Noir is the only red grape variety that can be legally blended into Prosecco to produce a rosé version, according …</span>

| Fermenting grapes and new oak have resonant odors all of their own.
The harmonious blend of sweet fruit and spicy oak isn&#x27;t the only bouquet associated with winemaking.

Every year it happens and it always makes me smile.
I know it’s coming but it still somehow feels serendipitous, a seasonal joy, something of the miracle of existence: the first smell of fermenting grapes.
This year – and to be honest, like most years – it was Chardonnnay. But, to be honest, the variety doesn&#x27;t matter so much; …</span>

But what about all those “pivots” we made last year — will any of those become permanent aspects of our everyday lives?

One new habit likely to stay with us: buying wine online. Some venture capital investors sure think so.

Western Australia will be unfamiliar to most people, but it has a long wine history and a great future.

When it comes to wine from the Land Down Under, Western Australia often lives in the shadow of Victorian and South Australian based wine regions.

  “I would rather make wine to the climate and soil rather than fashionable style.”	
 
 Chardonnay and pinot noir have asserted themselves over the last few decades to occupy a significant place in the psyche of Australian wine drinkers. Chardonnay has had a particularly stellar boom. It was a fringe variety until the 1970s, with a surge in popularity in the ’80s seeing plantings steadily increase to now account for nearly 45 per cent of all white wine production.

While this impacted all restaurant jobs, it was particularly dismal for the sommelier—a position that is not universal across restaurants and is often considered expendable when operators are forced to reduce labor costs.
Yet as summer approaches, the situation is far more optimistic. Restaurants have reopened in every state, and in many major markets, new sommelier job openings are posted daily.

                    <span>Five miles from Lake Michigan, on sloping hills and down a gravelly road, sits the Mountain Road Estates vineyard, owned by Michigan’s oldest winery, St. Julian. Located in the state’s “fruit belt,” the 25-acre vineyard is surrounded by neighboring peach, cherry, and blueberry farms. Near the entrance, rows of pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon grow just feet apart. Typically, these two varieties wouldn’t be seen in such close proximity — pinot noir thrives in colder clima…</span>

Wine textbooks are crucial, but they may only rarely move you. What about books that teach you not only how to think about wine but how to feel about it?

Rosé season? More like Lillet season. Just kidding—there’s room for both in the refrigerator.
For the uninitiated, Lillet (pronounced lee-LAY) is a French aromatized aperitif wine made with a blend of Bordeaux grapes and fortified with a blend of citrus liqueurs. There are three varieties to choose from: Lillet Blanc (made with Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon grapes), Lillet Rosé (a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sémillon grapes) and Lillet Rouge (Merlot a…</span>

The Hárslevelű grape, which is Furmint crossed with Tzimlyansky Belyi, has often languished in the shadow of its more famous parent. The reason for this is partly because there’s less grown – making up about 20% of the region’s production in 2020; Hárslevelű often goes into blends to make Furmint ‘more friendly…</span>

George Clooney&#x27;s purchase of a vineyard in Provence is contested.

        
There seems to be celebrity growth in Provence. According to the media, actor and filmmaker George Clooney and his wife, lawyer Amal Alamuddin, have bought a vineyard there. It is the Canadel estate in the southern French town of Brignoles (Departement Var), according to the town hall. 
But there seems to be a catch: according to the French news agency (AFP), another buyer is claiming this p…</span>

Léa Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow and chemist at the University of York, uses a mix of chemistry and archaeology to study the eating and drinking habits of people who lived thousands of years ago.
When an archeological dig unearths ancient pottery, for example, she works with a team of scientists to determine whether they were used to contain wine, vinegar or other fruit juices. “It’s a tricky question,” says Drieu.

Stroll off the beaten track of a mountainside or valley vineyard in the Western Cape winelands of South Africa and step into wild, straggly vegetation of every shape and size. Brushing through these bushes releases many scents: heady dried herbs, wildflowers, pungent spice and more.
This is fynbos, the Afrikaans word meaning fine-leaved plants. Fynbos is composed of around 8,500 species from several key families—Restionaceae, Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Rutaceae and Iridaceae…</span>

Scrupulous vineyard management and modern vinification methods yield inimitable, savory white wines loaded with personality.

                    <span>Tasting the 2020s was a real joy – not least because so many producers are defying hot, dry years with delightfully fresh, expressive, &#x27;new old&#x27; wines.

 This post has been a long time in coming. Way back when we started drinking wine at home with some decent wine glasses, we would wash the glasses and then just set them upside down on a towel. The end result of course was water spots on the glasses and that just doesn’t look good. Somebody had to wash AND dry the glasses and who do you think got that job? Yeah, you&amp;rs…</span>

                    <span>Over the past year, an influx of entrepreneurs has entered the wine industry. Through job losses or reduced working hours, industry changes forced wine pros to find new ways of making a living. With restaurant shutdowns, many sommeliers moved to virtual spaces, where they live-streamed tastings and seminars, and cultivated social media brands. Consultants transitioned from curating restaurant wine lists to online wine clubs.

The more closely you look at a word, wrote the early 20th-century aphorist Karl Kraus, the more distantly it looks back at you.
This nugget of wisdom couldn’t be more true when it comes to the name of one of Puglia’s most important grape varieties, Negroamaro.

Megan Bell, winemaker at Margins Wine, is frustrated by the term “natural wine.”
While there’s no official U.S. designation, it generally refers to wines made without chemicals, flavoring or coloring agents, as well as no added sugars or acids, fining or filtration. Many believe that natural wines should be made without additional sulfur or temperature-controlling agents like dry ice, though others make exceptions for those practices. Despite such porous parameters, Bell finds the te…</span>

A couple months later, I noticed a natural wine endcap at my local wine shop. Next, an onslaught of orange wine populated my Instagram feed until, finally, it seemed natural wine was all anyone in my online or offline social circles wanted to drink.

Where establishments with the library approach once dominated the market with their towering stacks of cases and big-name, blue-chip wines on pedestals, smaller shops with eclectic, affordable wines and attentive, casual service have come to the fore. Wine shopping has become, well, cool. Nudged along by the pandemic, the world of retail wine seems to be experiencing a great awakening.

Your wine tasting notes are probably wrong – for other people, at least.

 Furmint is building a reputation as the next big thing for thrilling dry white wines. It channels Riesling in having the ability to go from bone-dry to lusciously sweet in style, always underscored by a streak of refreshing acidity. Then it can also resemble Chardonnay, being capable of producing fine sparkling wine, steely linear whites (think mouthwatering, spicy Chablis) and complex, layered ones (think Burgundy on steroids).
This all makes genetic sense: Furmint is…</span>

                    <span>The modern canned wine movement has been developing apace in the US for several years, but the concept has also become more popular in the UK recently.
Cans are a great option for al fresco drinking and picnics, which is something to consider as the UK government prepares to allow more outdoor meet-ups.

| Barolo&#x27;s 2017 vintage was hot, so be careful when you are choosing which wines to buy.
Heat was the big issue for the 2017 vintage in Barolo – and that is reflected in the wines.

The new releases of Barolo from the 2017 vintage are just now entering the market, and as far as judging these wines, a sound bite won&#x27;t do this year justice.
Of course, a few select words should never be used to rate any Barolo vintage, but given the consistently excellent performances by the ar…</span>

How much is too much? How many tons per acre should end up in the fermenter? And is it even possible to make fine wine from a high-yielding vineyard?

                    <span>One of the attractions of wine is that it is a drink that – in some mysterious way – allows us a connection with a place.
 The classical European model of wine is that it has an address. You buy a Barolo, or a St-Emilion, or a Volnay, or Chianti Classico. The grape varieties they are made from are almost immaterial – of course, with time, certain varieties have been linked with place, but it was very rare to see them on the label (Germany and Alsace being the notable exceptions, perhaps).

                    <span>Wine is a global commodity, but does it make for a better product when everything is locally sourced?
The history of wine-grape cultivation dates to at least 6,000 B.C., and it’s deeply intertwined with the development of civilizations, empires and global trade. Grapes are planted on every continent except Antarctica, and producers craft bottlings from grape varieties indigenous to regions across the planet.
But increasingly, winemakers try to source ingredients from closer to home in a bid, they say,…</span>

                    <span>Hello, readers!  I’m going to diverge from my usual m.o and present today a slightly older study than I usually do.  Instead of being published in the last year, this one was published in 2017.  Why?
