A couple months later, I noticed a natural wine endcap at my local wine shop. Next, an onslaught of orange wine populated my Instagram feed until, finally, it seemed natural wine was all anyone in my online or offline social circles wanted to drink.

The wine economy in China is still struggling, however, with high inventory levels remaining due to last year&rsquo;s lockdowns. Selling off the surplus stock without eroding price points and reputations is serious concern. Recently reports highlight creative solutions to the problem.

Where establishments with the library approach once dominated the market with their towering stacks of cases and big-name, blue-chip wines on pedestals, smaller shops with eclectic, affordable wines and attentive, casual service have come to the fore. Wine shopping has become, well, cool. Nudged along by the pandemic, the world of retail wine seems to be experiencing a great awakening.

In order to study the clonal genetic diversity of Malbec grapevines, the authors of this post generated whole-genome resequencing data for four accessions with different clonal propagation records.

Jack Frost holds an icy sword above the heads of many vineyard managers.

Change comes slowly in Rioja. Many of the winemaking practices that were in place when the region was established in the third quarter of the 19th century are widely used today. Grapes are pressed traditionally and most of the best wines are aged, sometimes for many years, in oak barrels of various sizes, with a preference towards American oak. Many winemakers see oxidation during aging as an asset, not a flaw, that when done correctl…</p>

When asked about their archetypal consumer, many wine brand owners default to a similar answer: someone educated, high earning, well respected, aesthetically sophisticated, thoughtful, adventurous, enlightened, looking to demonstrate their cultural maturity but not in a flashy way. In other words, a sort of idealised version of them…</p>

When White Claw and other hard seltzers scratched their way onto the scene in 2016, the wine industry was thrown on its heels. The new category exploded almost overnight, growing exponentially year-over year, unabated by even the pandemic.
What was a $41 million industry five years ago is projected to exceed $2.5 billion in 2021, and it may reach $14.5 billion by 2027. That&rsquo;s still nowhere near wine&rsquo;s more than $330 billion annual impact, but every bite hurts.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Last week, I had a look at which countries principally consume wine and which consume more beer (Beer countries and wine countries). One could then ask, as did one of my correspondents (Vicky Corbeels), whether bigger wine-producing countries drink more wine than do countries that produce less.
So, let's have another look at the data for 2015, as contained in the Annual Database of Global Wine Markets, compiled by Anderson,&nbsp; Nelgen and Pinilla. Tables 19 (Volume of wine production per capita) and 23 (V…</p>

                <p>Everyone&rsquo;s been there. You pull out a bottle of wine for dinner, only to find it&rsquo;s past its prime.
Even if there&rsquo;s already plenty of cooking wine in the fridge, don&rsquo;t dump that bottle down the kitchen sink. Make vinegar instead.
&ldquo;Unlike store-bought vinegar, which can have an aggressive or sharp vinegar flavor, homemade vinegar has a softer tang to it and more alternative flavors that step forward,&rdquo; says Toni Dash, a professional writer and blogger at Boulder Locavore.

                <p>Freezing temperatures during the early morning hours of April 6, 7 and 8 brought severe frosts to Burgundy vineyards, damaging Chardonnay and Pinot Noir buds from the M&acirc;connais to Chablis and setting up 2021 as a challenging vintage for the region.
 Growers scrambled to light candles in the vineyards in the hopes of raising the near-ground temperatures by a degree, yet even with protection, the frost killed many young buds. Tuesday night brought the most devastation, when snow and rain exacerbated the…</p>

Many times that sommelier was (or is) me, and often in that moment, I&rsquo;ve hesitated. You want to know what I, a stranger, think you should have with your meal, with no clue what you actually like? Sometimes I just want to look you i…</p>
