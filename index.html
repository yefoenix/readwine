When White Claw and other hard seltzers scratched their way onto the scene in 2016, the wine industry was thrown on its heels. The new category exploded almost overnight, growing exponentially year-over year, unabated by even the pandemic.

The Toro DO, located on Spain&rsquo;s Duero River just west of Rueda, has been making wine since pre-Roman times. It is even said that the rich, red wines of the area were a favorite of King Alfonso IX of Le&oacute;n back in the 13th century.
Most of the wine produced in the Toro DO is based on the Tinta del Toro grape variety&mdash;considered to be a local clone of Tempranillo. This local variant has thicker skins and deeper color than the Tempranillo grapes grow…</p>

 Vitis vinifera grape is a

metabolites change as a function of the balance between biosynthesis and
metabolization and growth-related dilution effects (Bigard et al., 2018 &amp;

What Is the Role of Heimat in Terroir?

It has forced us to rely on at-home experiences like a glass of wine to satisfy our longing for travel. But what do the places of our terroir dreams taste like? What exactly constitutes the origins of a wine? To use a loaded German word, how much Heimat (loosely, homeland) is in terroir?
