Scotch whisky&#x27;s mad scientist sets his sights on Sonoma for a different take on Glenmorangie.

Would Glenmorangie&#x27;s director of whisky creation Bill Lumsden have left his whisky in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay casks for 15 years if he hadn&#x27;t forgotten all about it?
No way, he says: it should have been tannic, austere and horrible after all that time, which was what happened the first time he experimented with Tokaj casks. He loved the result o…</span>

关于葡萄酒审美的标准，无论是专业人士还是爱好者，都未能达成共识。
WSET教育尝试指给我们一条道路：BLCT，即通过“平衡性”（balance）、“余味长短”（length）、“复杂度”（complexity）和“典型性”（typicity）四大标准来评判一款酒的质量。该评价体系容易上手和掌握，但缺点也非常明显：它可以应付葡萄酒世界中90%的酒款，但一旦上升到大酒阶段，便不足以展现出酒款之间的参差。
而大酒之所以为大酒，一定比BLCT满分酒多了某种难以言说的气质，使其超凡脱俗、无可取代。这种气质即为风格（style）。正所谓，好可以千篇一律，美必须独树一帜。这就好比在时尚界，越是顶级的大牌，其风格越鲜明，且一经确立就不再改变，无论经过多少次季节轮转，始终万变不离其宗。

When it launched in 1858, founder Don Guillermo Hurtado de Amezaga insisted on selling his wines in bottle rather than barrel – the first winery in Rioja to do so. A guarantee to his customers that they were getting what they paid for, it followed the practices of the great estates of Bordeaux and was a powerful statement of intent.
It was clearly justified: in 1895 Marqués de Riscal became the first non-French winery to win a Diplome d’Honneur at the …</span>

WTF are NFTs? You might well ask, but they could be crucial in combating counterfeit wine.

It&#x27;s one thing to shell out $20 for a Gucci on Canal Street in New York City – you know what you&#x27;re getting and it ain&#x27;t Gucci, baby! – but it&#x27;s another thing entirely to spend several thousand on what you believe the real deal is from a well-regarded retailer.

△ 日本秋田市内的“新政”看板


“新政酒造”于1852年（江户时代末期）在日本东北地区秋田县创立。而佐藤祐辅是其第八任社长。他出生于1974年，适逢日本经济高度成长期，清酒的销售有极好的势头。在这个鼎盛期过了以后，清酒的消费每况愈下。近两年，出货量还不及20世纪70年代的一半。相反，海外的输出量倒是在不断增加。



佐藤祐辅在东京大学文学部毕业以后，在记者这个行业闯荡了几年。2007年，他选择回到老家造酒。作为一位经历特殊，并且在这变革期肩负着使命的新一代经营者，我们听听他怎么说。

「制造以信念为名的清酒。」

Q：孩提时代，你是如何看待制酒这种家业的？
佐藤：我住的地方和造酒的酒藏之间隔着条河，所以家离酒藏一点也不近。至于造酒现场嘛，其实是很危险的。所以，我并不是看着造酒的制作过程长大的。如…</span>

根据《卫报》最新报道，近日，西班牙巴斯克地区超过50名酿酒师正在寻求欧盟批准他们脱离里奥哈DOCa认证，即不在他们的酒标上面贴上里奥哈（Rioja DOCa）的标签。

众所周知，里奥哈优质原产地分为三个子产区：上里奥哈（La Rioja）、里奥哈阿拉维萨
（Rioja Alavesa）和东里奥Rioja Oriental(原下里奥哈Rioja Baja)，这些子产区在地理上跨越三个自治区，包括拉里奥哈、纳瓦拉和位于巴斯克地区的阿拉瓦（Álava）。
根据报道，巴斯克大区里奥哈阿拉维萨子产区辖下的50多名酿酒师希望退出里奥哈优质原产地，并创建他们自己的原产地命名，新产区名字为：Arabako Mahastiak或Viñedos de Álava。（只有我觉着这个新名字很笨重吗？）

新提议已经获得了巴斯克执政党民族主义党派和马德里政府的批准，并已提交给欧盟等待批准。

A discussion ensues, and at one point a more experienced drinker – maybe a wine trade person – steps in and says why don’t you try wine Y instead of this – it costs about the same, or maybe just a little more, and it’s a much better wine. You might like it more.

Striding through the rows of grapevines in Sonoma’s Moon Mountain Vineyard, Erich Bradley waves an arm at the burnt-brown grass and chaparral surrounding his vineyard.
“The flora and fauna that surround the vineyard are so dry, it looks like the second week of July instead of the second week of May,” the winemaker says.

Paolo Lasagni, managing director at Casa Vinicolo Bosco, told db that pink Prosecco relied on young vineyards planted across the nine production zones of Prosecco, many of which were not offering substantial yields.

| Fermenting grapes and new oak have resonant odors all of their own.
The harmonious blend of sweet fruit and spicy oak isn&#x27;t the only bouquet associated with winemaking.

Every year it happens and it always makes me smile.
I know it’s coming but it still somehow feels serendipitous, a seasonal joy, something of the miracle of existence: the first smell of fermenting grapes.
This year – and to be honest, like most years – it was Chardonnnay. But, to be honest, the variety doesn&#x27;t matter so much; …</span>

One new habit likely to stay with us: buying wine online. Some venture capital investors sure think so.

Western Australia will be unfamiliar to most people, but it has a long wine history and a great future.

  “I would rather make wine to the climate and soil rather than fashionable style.”	
 
 Chardonnay and pinot noir have asserted themselves over the last few decades to occupy a significant place in the psyche of Australian wine drinkers. Chardonnay has had a particularly stellar boom. It was a fringe variety until the 1970s, with a surge in popularity in the ’80s seeing plantings steadily increase to now account for nearly 45 per cent of all white wine production.

While this impacted all restaurant jobs, it was particularly dismal for the sommelier—a position that is not universal across restaurants and is often considered expendable when operators are forced to reduce labor costs.
Yet as summer approaches, the situation is far more optimistic. Restaurants have reopened in every state, and in many major markets, new sommelier job openings are posted daily.

| The vintage was the third good one in a row and continues almost a decade of success for Bordeaux.
The release of the 2020 wines shows the lockdown vintage lived up to its promise.

Well, here we are. Another lockdown en primeur campaign. It worked last year. Can Bordeaux pull it off again?
Before we look at the 2020s and what they taste like, let’s put them in context. It&#x27;s the third of three very good years – again. There was 1988, 1989 and 1990, and then there was 2008, 2009 a…</span>

                    <span>Five miles from Lake Michigan, on sloping hills and down a gravelly road, sits the Mountain Road Estates vineyard, owned by Michigan’s oldest winery, St. Julian. Located in the state’s “fruit belt,” the 25-acre vineyard is surrounded by neighboring peach, cherry, and blueberry farms. Near the entrance, rows of pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon grow just feet apart. Typically, these two varieties wouldn’t be seen in such close proximity — pinot noir thrives in colder clima…</span>

Rosé season? More like Lillet season. Just kidding—there’s room for both in the refrigerator.
For the uninitiated, Lillet (pronounced lee-LAY) is a French aromatized aperitif wine made with a blend of Bordeaux grapes and fortified with a blend of citrus liqueurs. There are three varieties to choose from: Lillet Blanc (made with Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon grapes), Lillet Rosé (a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sémillon grapes) and Lillet Rouge (Merlot a…</span>

On one level, the most northerly wine region of Italy is easy to understand. Nobody is left unmoved by the spectacular combination of the snow-capped Alps, verdant glacial valleys, mountain meadows and many vineyards.

The Hárslevelű grape, which is Furmint crossed with Tzimlyansky Belyi, has often languished in the shadow of its more famous parent. The reason for this is partly because there’s less grown – making up about 20% of the region’s production in 2020; Hárslevelű often goes into blends to make Furmint ‘more friendly…</span>

George Clooney&#x27;s purchase of a vineyard in Provence is contested.

        
There seems to be celebrity growth in Provence. According to the media, actor and filmmaker George Clooney and his wife, lawyer Amal Alamuddin, have bought a vineyard there. It is the Canadel estate in the southern French town of Brignoles (Departement Var), according to the town hall. 
But there seems to be a catch: according to the French news agency (AFP), another buyer is claiming this p…</span>

Léa Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow and chemist at the University of York, uses a mix of chemistry and archaeology to study the eating and drinking habits of people who lived thousands of years ago.
When an archeological dig unearths ancient pottery, for example, she works with a team of scientists to determine whether they were used to contain wine, vinegar or other fruit juices. “It’s a tricky question,” says Drieu.

Stroll off the beaten track of a mountainside or valley vineyard in the Western Cape winelands of South Africa and step into wild, straggly vegetation of every shape and size. Brushing through these bushes releases many scents: heady dried herbs, wildflowers, pungent spice and more.
This is fynbos, the Afrikaans word meaning fine-leaved plants. Fynbos is composed of around 8,500 species from several key families—Restionaceae, Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Rutaceae and Iridaceae…</span>

Managers of the operation, which was purchased by E. &amp; J. Gallo along with about 30 other Constellation wine and spirits brands for $1.7 billion in January, held a meeting Thursday at 10 a.m. and told employees they were being laid off immediately.

                    <span>The aim in tasting wines before they arrive on the retailers’ shelves is simply to assess their future. Wines that are tasted en primeur are generally those from the most recent vintage, just a few months old, or the vintage before and almost always not yet in bottle. The exception is vintage Port, where vintages are declared during the second year after the harvest and only tasted once in bottle.
In my view, assessments for the future can only be based on form in the shape of as much background infor…</span>

| A woman&#x27;s walk is never done, it would appear.
Johnnie Walker wants to be clear that it doesn&#x27;t make whisky for women, despite any evidence to the contrary.
By W. Blake Gray | Posted Monday, 10-May-2021

Jane Walker is NOT a whisky for women.
No way. Take it from master blender Emma Walker, whose name and signature are on the bottle: &quot;If I had been told I was creating a whisky for women I would have asked someone else to do the project.&quot;
