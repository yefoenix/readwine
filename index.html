L&eacute;a Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow and chemist at the University of York, uses a mix of chemistry and archaeology to study the eating and drinking habits of people who lived thousands of years ago.
When an archeological dig unearths ancient pottery, for example, she works with a team of scientists to determine whether they were used to contain wine, vinegar or other fruit juices. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tricky question,&rdquo; says Drieu.

Stroll off the beaten track of a mountainside or valley vineyard in the Western Cape winelands of South Africa and step into wild, straggly vegetation of every shape and size. Brushing through these bushes releases many scents: heady dried herbs, wildflowers, pungent spice and more.
This is fynbos, the Afrikaans word meaning fine-leaved plants. Fynbos is composed of around 8,500 species from several key families&mdash;Restionaceae, Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Rutaceae and Iridaceae…</span>

                      <span>The aim in tasting wines before they arrive on the retailers&rsquo; shelves is simply to assess their future. Wines that are tasted en primeur are generally those from the most recent vintage, just a few months old, or the vintage before and almost always not yet in bottle. The exception is vintage Port, where vintages are declared during the second year after the harvest and only tasted once in bottle.

| A woman's walk is never done, it would appear.
Johnnie Walker wants to be clear that it doesn't make whisky for women, despite any evidence to the contrary.
By W. Blake Gray | Posted Monday, 10-May-2021

Jane Walker is NOT a whisky for women.
No way. Take it from master blender Emma Walker, whose name and signature are on the bottle: "If I had been told I was creating a whisky for women I would have asked someone else to do the project."

Megan Bell, winemaker at Margins Wine, is frustrated by the term &ldquo;natural wine.&rdquo;
While there&rsquo;s no official U.S. designation, it generally refers to wines made without chemicals, flavoring or coloring agents, as well as no added sugars or acids, fining or filtration. Many believe that natural wines should be made without additional sulfur or temperature-controlling agents like dry ice, though others make exceptions for those practices. Despite such porous parameters, Bell finds the te…</span>

                      <span>Are wine influencers mining the depths and potential of Instagram really just put-upon, underpaid, disparaged journalists working in a new medium that the sexist wine industry is too male and too old to understand or appreciate?

 Furmint is building a reputation as the next big thing for thrilling dry white wines. It channels Riesling in having the ability to go from bone-dry to lusciously sweet in style, always underscored by a streak of refreshing acidity. Then it can also resemble Chardonnay, being capable of producing fine sparkling wine, steely linear whites (think mouthwatering, spicy Chablis) and complex, layered ones (think Burgundy on steroids).

                      <span>There have been many comments about wine critics, especially concerning various characteristics of their wine ratings, including things like inflation and inconsistency. One thing that I could look at here is the matter of "top-rated" wines, and how their scores vary from year to year.
In this regard, James Suckling provides an annual list of Top 100 Wines, which is worth looking into; so, I have collated the scores for the years 2014 to 2020, inclusive. [Thanks to James for giving me access to his database…</span>

                      <span>Malbec is a cultivar that is well-appreciated for the elaboration of red wine. It originated in Southwestern France and was introduced in Argentina during the 1850s. In order to study the clonal genetic diversity of Malbec grapevines, the authors of this post generated whole-genome resequencing data for four accessions with different clonal propagation records. The results show the usefulness of this approach for the study of the scarce intra-cultivar genetic diversity in grapevines. We also provide evidenc…</span>

It's been a crazy week, so here are some wine stories that might have passed you by.

| Barolo's 2017 vintage was hot, so be careful when you are choosing which wines to buy.
Heat was the big issue for the 2017 vintage in Barolo &ndash; and that is reflected in the wines.

The new releases of Barolo from the 2017 vintage are just now entering the market, and as far as judging these wines, a sound bite won't do this year justice.
Of course, a few select words should never be used to rate any Barolo vintage, but given the consistently excellent performances by the ar…</span>

| Traditional wisdom says that lower yields mean better wine, but is that true?

How much is too much? How many tons per acre should end up in the fermenter? And is it even possible to make fine wine from a high-yielding vineyard?
The relationship between quality and quantity is one of those brilliantly geeky subjects that has no simple answer. I read with interest a recent piece by Alex Russan &ndash; it skilfully debunked the&nbsp; myth that there is no grey matter in the subject of grape yie…</span>

                      <span>One of the attractions of wine is that it is a drink that &ndash; in some mysterious way &ndash; allows us a connection with a place.
 The classical European model of wine is that it has an address. You buy a Barolo, or a St-Emilion, or a Volnay, or Chianti Classico. The grape varieties they are made from are almost immaterial &ndash; of course, with time, certain varieties have been linked with place, but it was very rare to see them on the label (Germany and Alsace being the notable exceptions, perhaps).

                      <span>Wine is a global commodity, but does it make for a better product when everything is locally sourced?
The history of wine-grape cultivation dates to at least 6,000 B.C., and it&rsquo;s deeply intertwined with the development of civilizations, empires and global trade. Grapes are planted on every continent except Antarctica, and producers craft bottlings from grape varieties indigenous to regions across the planet.
But increasingly, winemakers try to source ingredients from closer to home in a bid, they say,…</span>
