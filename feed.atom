关于葡萄酒审美的标准，无论是专业人士还是爱好者，都未能达成共识。
WSET教育尝试指给我们一条道路：BLCT，即通过“平衡性”（balance）、“余味长短”（length）、“复杂度”（complexity）和“典型性”（typicity）四大标准来评判一款酒的质量。该评价体系容易上手和掌握，但缺点也非常明显：它可以应付葡萄酒世界中90%的酒款，但一旦上升到大酒阶段，便不足以展现出酒款之间的参差。
而大酒之所以为大酒，一定比BLCT满分酒多了某种难以言说的气质，使其超凡脱俗、无可取代。这种气质即为风格（style）。正所谓，好可以千篇一律，美必须独树一帜。这就好比在时尚界，越是顶级的大牌，其风格越鲜明，且一经确立就不再改变，无论经过多少次季节轮转，始终万变不离其宗。

△ 日本秋田市内的“新政”看板


“新政酒造”于1852年（江户时代末期）在日本东北地区秋田县创立。而佐藤祐辅是其第八任社长。他出生于1974年，适逢日本经济高度成长期，清酒的销售有极好的势头。在这个鼎盛期过了以后，清酒的消费每况愈下。近两年，出货量还不及20世纪70年代的一半。相反，海外的输出量倒是在不断增加。



佐藤祐辅在东京大学文学部毕业以后，在记者这个行业闯荡了几年。2007年，他选择回到老家造酒。作为一位经历特殊，并且在这变革期肩负着使命的新一代经营者，我们听听他怎么说。

根据《卫报》最新报道，近日，西班牙巴斯克地区超过50名酿酒师正在寻求欧盟批准他们脱离里奥哈DOCa认证，即不在他们的酒标上面贴上里奥哈（Rioja DOCa）的标签。

众所周知，里奥哈优质原产地分为三个子产区：上里奥哈（La Rioja）、里奥哈阿拉维萨
（Rioja Alavesa）和东里奥Rioja Oriental(原下里奥哈Rioja Baja)，这些子产区在地理上跨越三个自治区，包括拉里奥哈、纳瓦拉和位于巴斯克地区的阿拉瓦（Álava）。
根据报道，巴斯克大区里奥哈阿拉维萨子产区辖下的50多名酿酒师希望退出里奥哈优质原产地，并创建他们自己的原产地命名，新产区名字为：Arabako Mahastiak或Viñedos de Álava。（只有我觉着这个新名字很笨重吗？）

新提议已经获得了巴斯克执政党民族主义党派和马德里政府的批准，并已提交给欧盟等待批准。

Where establishments with the library approach once dominated the market with their towering stacks of cases and big-name, blue-chip wines on pedestals, smaller shops with eclectic, affordable wines and attentive, casual service have come to the fore.
